I really enjoyed this class. It was my first experience with a lisp-like language and forced me to think about programming differently than I do day to day with python & javascript. I am particulary happy about the constant use of recursion;  it gave me the opportunity to really understand how flexible it can be.  I look forwar to completing the remaining classes in the series.
